This is meant to be a basic app for distance finding on a golf course.

  User will select a spot on a map and the app will calculate the distance to that point based on the user's current location. Most of the other golf apps I have used were complicated to use and I gave up trying to find distances with them. I want this app to be very easy and quick. 
  Stretch goals would be to have users enter "their bag" and approprate distances for their clubs. The app could recommend a club based on the distance it calculates. Another stretch goal would be to have a simple to use scorecard.
